### Email 1: Introduction
Subject: Quick question about wealth building, {{contact.first_name}}

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

I was reviewing some numbers with a client today and thought of you. We were discussing how traditional investment strategies often lead to significantly less usable income than most people expect. It's fascinating how the numbers tell a completely different story than what most financial advisors discuss.

The conversation centered around something interesting - a client named Michael who had accumulated $1.2 million in traditional investment accounts. When we analyzed his actual usable monthly income after taxes and typical market fluctuations, it came to around $3,400 per month. He was pretty concerned when he saw those numbers, as this was less than half of what he'd been led to expect.

However, our discussion shifted when we looked at an alternative approach that many successful business owners are using. It's a strategy that lets you generate income without the typical tax burden, while maintaining access to your capital for other opportunities. Michael was particularly interested in how this approach allowed him to keep growing his business while building tax-advantaged income streams.

On the next email, I'll share some specific numbers about how taxes and market volatility affect your wealth building potential, and what you can do to protect yourself. These are insights that have really changed the perspective of many business owners and professionals I work with.

Best regards,

Let me know if you'd like to discuss how these concepts might apply to your situation.

### Email 2: Understanding Money Math
Subject: Why Most People Never Build Real Passive Income

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Let me ask you a simple question: If you put $10 in the market and it drops 50%, what's your balance? Obviously, $5. Now, if the market goes up 50% the next day, what's your balance? Most people think they're back to $10, but they're actually at $7.50. This is the hidden math that destroys wealth-building potential, and it's just the tip of the iceberg.
