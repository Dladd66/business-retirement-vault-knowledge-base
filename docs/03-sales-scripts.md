They have seen banks fail and don't want to keep putting money away into high risk investments, or they do not want their money trapped in an account where they can't access without penalties.

Which is it for you? Or is there something else you've been the most concerned about?"

2. Follow-up Questions:
- "Why does that concern you specifically?"
- "How long have you been concerned about this?"
- "Where did this concern come from?"

## Product Explanation

### Index Account Explanation
"An indexed account is a type of financial account that is linked to the market but not directly invested in the market. So what that means is that you have a contractual agreement with the company that states you will never lose money in the market. Now when the market goes up your money is going to increase with the market. They are just going to take a little of the top for themselves."

### Tax Benefits Explanation
"So under the IRS tax code 101(a) anything defined as a life insurance death benefit is tax free. Just like if you had a car accident and the insurance company sent you a check to fix your car, the government is not going to count that as income. It's money owed to you. Same thing when you use a life insurance policy to build up cash value."

## Closing Process

1. Budget Discussion:
"Now the biggest thing when it comes to investing and having your money grow long term is letting it continue to grow without consistently pulling from it. It's just like cooking if you are constantly taking the food off the burner it's going take way longer to enjoy. Same thing when it comes to your finances."

2. Application Process:
"So the next step is doing the application to see IF we can get you approved. In the application they're going to ask for your basic information like your driver's license information, birthday, social, and health."

3. Payment Setup:
"Great now the way the payment works is you can't pay anything today even if you want to. If everything gets approved then that is when the payments start. Then we pick the day each month it comes out automatically."
